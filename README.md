## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the Gym Club site  crucial for users of the site. A dark theme is used on this site, as well as pictures of the gym. This adds a little bit of mistery which can motivate people to to even better in the gym. The site shows pictures of the gym and studies shows that working out in the dark allows us to conect our body even more and it motivate us to be more effective. 

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is dark green colours followed with red letters to make a text and social networks pop up even more. 

### Fonts
The Redit+Mono font is the main font used on this website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font just in case Redit+Mono is not imported well.
